# CLAHE
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
Change your cliplimit for better outputs.

The simple histogram method suffers from intensity saturation which results
in information loss, which is not acceptable in the case of medical images. Thus,
whenever we want to retain the details of the image while improving the quality
of the image, CLAHE is one of the best option to go for. In medical images,
where intensity of the images are very dark, CLAHE provides a better image.

Steps to run the code:
1. Open MATLAB and go to the path where fn_CLAHE.m is stored.
2. Give the image name in Run as 'example.jpg'
3. Run the program and see your result
